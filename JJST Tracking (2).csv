Unfortunately, we are unable to provide fiber to 392 Kamoku Pl, Lanai right now. There are plans however under work order HLNCY102, that is scheduled to build fiber terminals that would be able to serve this address. This work order is scheduled to be ready around November 2023. If the customer is still interested then, you can reach back out and we can check again during that time.

That stated, the OSP data in AAIS-NB is dated, and it appears that the site is too far from the CO for HTTV service (5000 to 6000FT).
